      <h1>From Humble Beginnings…</h1>

      <p>In 1979 Monty Python made a movie called <i>Life of Brian</i>, which
        was kinda good. Then a bunch of religious zealots went bananas, and
        decided they wanted the movie banned. (’Cause we can’t have people
        freely going about <i>speaking their mind,</i> now can we?) Banning was
        achieved in parts of the <abbr>UK</abbr> (and several other European
        countries) and the whole thing blew up in the media at the time.

      <p>Norway (often considered the funniest<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>
        country in Scandinavia) banned the film. This prompted the cinemas here
        (in the neighboring Sweden) to advertise the movie with the slogan “So
        funny it was banned in Norway.”

          minutes)</nobr></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The controversies also affected the film content. Originally there was
        a recurring character, called <i>Otto, the Nazirene,</i> who, with his
        squad of professional suicide warriors, was seeking his prophesied
        leader, and striving to keep the Jewish race pure. But, alas, he and
        his brave troupe was left on the cutting room floor, and the
        iconic <i>Swastika of David</i> that adorned his helmet, was never to
        be seen on the big screen. <nobr>– All</nobr> we see of them in the
        final movie is the suicide squad that promptly kills itself in its
        attempt to rescue Brian from the cross.

      <h1>Blasphemous Rumours</h1>

      <p>Then, in November the same year, a <abbr>BBC</abbr> <abbr>TV</abbr> show
        called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_Night,_Saturday_Morning#Monty_Python.27s_Life_of_Brian"><i>Friday
        Night, Saturday Morning</i></a> hosted a “debate” between the bishop of
        Southwark, some semi-famous born again christian dude, and John Cleese
        and Michael Palin from the Python gang. The christians managed to
        dominate the show, behaving like uneducated cretins, while both the
        Pythons <nobr>– when</nobr> they managed to get a word
        in <nobr>edgewise –</nobr> wound up sounding like wise old men. (A role
        reversal that seem to have been equally unexpected to both parties.)

      <h1><i>Not the Nine O’Clock News</i></h1>

      <p>Soon after (presumably late 1979 or early 1980) the <i>Friday Night,
        Saturday Morning</i> debate, the British humour show <i>Not the Nine
        O’Clock News</i> celebrated the debate in a sketch where everything is
        turned on its head, and the revered Monty Python gang have been
        blasphemed against in a new controversial movie called <i>Life of
        Christ</i> (in which this Christ figure is just an “accidental” rip-off
        of John Cleese – They even share the same <i>initials</i> for Python’s
        sake!).

      <h1><i>The Secret Life of Brian</i></h1>

      <p>In 2007 <abbr>UK</abbr>’s Channel 4 broadcast <i>The Secret Life of Brian</i>, a
        documentary about the Python film, featuring new interviews with the
        Pythons themselves and reflections on the movie and events surrounding
        it.

      <h1><i>Holy Flying Circus</i></h1>

      <p>In 2011 another <abbr>BBC</abbr> film was produced, detailing the
        events around the famous debate. This time in the form of a dramatized
        documentary in sketch form.

      <h2>Some Final Musings</h2>

      <p>It’s also interesting to note that, as late as July 2008, at least
        some of these <abbr>UK</abbr> bans of <i>Life of Brian</i> are <i>still
        in effect.</i> Have a look at this article, for example: “<a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150916171415/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/20/localgovernment">New
        Role for Python Star: Lifting Ban on <i>Life of Brian</i></a>”.

      <h2>Footnotes</h2>

      <p><sup id=fn1>1</sup> It’s probably partly that Norwegian
        just <i>sounds</i> funny to a Swede, and partly because of a certain
        kind of pithy joke (called a “Norwegian story”) which are oft repeated
        in the school yards, where the punch line involves a Norwegian making a
        fool out of himself in some way.
